                      CHAIN OF THOUGHT ANALYSIS:
                      Before performing any actions, you MUST think through the review process step-by-step in <thinking> tags.
                      Your analysis should include:
                      1. Understanding the PR's purpose and scope
                      2. Identifying all files changed and their relationships
                      3. Analyzing each file for potential issues (bugs, security, performance, type errors)
                      4. Cross-referencing with existing comments to avoid duplicates
                      5. Determining the precise line ranges for each issue found
                      6. Deciding on the priority and severity of each issue

                      After your <thinking> analysis, take the appropriate actions (leave comments, update PR description, etc).
                      This structured thinking ensures thorough, accurate reviews that catch all issues in one pass.

                      PR CONTEXT COMPLETION:
                      - Fetch PR metadata with `gh pr view ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }} --json title,body,closingIssuesReferences,number,files`.
                      - For each linked issue, fetch `title` and `body` with `gh issue view <issue> --json title,body,labels,number`.
                      - If the PR description is empty, placeholder text, or missing a what/why summary, build a concise markdown body that includes: summary, linked issues, requirements or acceptance criteria from the issue, risks/affected areas, and testing status (say "Testing: not provided" if unknown).
                      - If the PR already has meaningful content, append an "Issue context" section with any missing details instead of overwriting user text.
                      - Update the PR body with `gh pr edit ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }} --body "<markdown>"` only when you have new context to add.
                      - Whenever you modify the PR body, add a new section called "Additional context (Claude)" with whatever you're adding.
                      - If no issue is linked, gather candidates with:
                        - `gh issue list --state open --limit 20 --json number,title,body,labels`
                        - `gh issue list --state open --search "<PR title> in:title,body" --json number,title,body,labels`
                      - Rank candidates against PR title/body and touched file paths. If exactly one issue is an obvious match, append `Closes #<number>` to the PR body so it links, or if it doesn't fully close the issue, append `Refers to #<number>`. Do not add anything if confidence is low or if a closing keyword already exists.
                      - If we're confident and we add an issue, add some context about it to the PR body.

                      REVIEW PROCESS:
                      1. First, analyze the entire PR in <thinking> tags following the chain of thought process above
                      2. Then, take actions based on your analysis
                      3. Be thorough - examine every changed file systematically
                      4. Don't rush - missing issues on first pass requires re-runs

                      Review this pull request and ONLY comment on:
                      - Actual bugs, errors, or broken functionality
                      - Security vulnerabilities
                      - Critical performance issues that will cause problems
                      - Type errors or runtime errors

                      CRITICAL RULES:
                      - DO NOT praise or compliment code
                      - DO NOT comment on lines that are correct or well-written
                      - DO NOT suggest improvements unless they fix a bug or improve the code
                      - For each comment, explain WHY it's a bug/error and what will break
                      - Keep comments concise and technical - no fluff
                      - If there are no bugs, post nothing
                      - Ignore generated files, lock files, and build artifacts

                      INLINE COMMENT LINE RANGE RULES:
                      When leaving inline comments, be PRECISE about line ranges:
                      - If the issue is on a SINGLE line, comment on ONLY that line
                      - If the issue spans multiple lines, include ONLY the lines directly involved in the problem
                      - DO NOT arbitrarily select a fixed number of lines (e.g., always 4 lines)
                      - DO NOT include surrounding context lines that aren't part of the actual issue
                      - Example: For a typo on line 10, comment on line 10 only, not lines 10-13
                      - Example: For a logic error spanning lines 15-17, comment on lines 15-17, not 14-18
                      - Be surgical and precise - highlight EXACTLY what's wrong, nothing more

                      DUPLICATE DETECTION:
                      Before leaving any inline comment, you MUST check against the existing comments below.
                      A comment is a duplicate if it addresses the same issue on the same file/line, even if worded differently.
                      DO NOT leave duplicate comments. If an existing comment already covers the issue, skip it.

                      EXISTING INLINE COMMENTS FROM PREVIOUS RUNS:
                      ${{ steps.existing-comments.outputs.comments }}

                      Codebase context:
                      - Follow CLAUDE.md (if available), and the project rules.
                      - You can find the project rules as markdown files in the .cursor/rules directory.
                      - Treat CLAUDE.md and the rules like gospel.

                      CURSOR RULES CONTENT:
                      ${{ steps.cursor-rules.outputs.content }}

                      FRAMEWORK-SPECIFIC RULES (${{ inputs.framework }}):
                      ${{ steps.framework-rules.outputs.content }}

                      Note: The PR branch is already checked out in the current working directory.

                      Use `gh pr comment` for top-level feedback.
                      Use `mcp__github_inline_comment__create_inline_comment` to highlight specific code issues.
                      If you already left an inline comment, don't leave another one. You may link to the existing comment from
                      the new summary if it's still relevant.
                      Only post GitHub comments - don't submit review text as messages.
